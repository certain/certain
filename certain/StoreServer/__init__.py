"""StoreServer provides a number of plugins which can provide a store
service on a server.

There are currently 2 plugins available:  ``webserver`` and ``gitdaemon``.

These can be used to simplify provision of a store, e.g using the
``webserver`` StoreServer instead of installing a 3rd party webserver
such as Apache.
